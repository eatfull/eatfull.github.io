		<ol style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
			<li>We does not implement the searching/ordering food functionalities, since it requires heavily Javascript knowledge and we are not able to learn it by ourselves.</li>
			<li>Instead of providing ordering food functions, we provided the abilities to view popular restaurants in Waterloo and the brief introductions for the restaurants.</li>
			<li>We are not able to get all data from restaurants and loaded them to our website, since it also requires a lot of JavaScript and PHP/SQL (as backend) knowledge after we spent a faily amount of time researching.</li>
			<li>We tried to establish cooperation relationship with some restaurants in Waterloo and received some great responses; however we are not able to get all restaurants in every city due to the time limit.</li>
			<li>Due to the time limit, we are not able to collect all the menus from restaurants in Waterloo and updating menu in real time requires Javascript so we does not implement this functionality. </li>
			<li>We tried to establish connections delivery people and ask about the feedbacks, most of them are interested in but due to the reason that we are not a real business they kindly refused our requests. </li>
			<li>We are not able to implement the login/logout functions by purely html/css, since it requires both front-end part and back-end part, which we have not thought about before starting coding the website.</li>
